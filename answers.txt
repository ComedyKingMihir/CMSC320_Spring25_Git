Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows for code tracking, which lets you see code history. It is mainly used for collaboration, as
        multiple people can work on multiple parts of a project at the same time, and upload it to a central
        repository. A neat feature that aids in collaboration is the ability to develop features on an isolated
        branch, ensuring the stable version is not modified. These branches also allow for peer reveiws, allowing
        developers to review code through pull requests before committing to the main branch. "Very Nice." - Borat.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to bioinformatics. For example, machine learning models can analyze DNA sequences 
	to identify genetic mutations linked to diseases.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines two branches and keeps track of where they came together with a new commit. Rebasing moves 
	changes from one branch to another as if they were made there in the first place, making the history look 
	cleaner but changing past commits.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I am looking forward to learning more about Data Science as an industry, and how it can be applied to other 
	industries. I originally took this class wanting to go straight into Data Science right out of college, but
	our current job market may prohibit that.
