Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows for code tracking, which lets you see code history. It is mainly used for collaboration, as
        multiple people can work on multiple parts of a project at the same time, and upload it to a central
        repository. A neat feature that aids in collaboration is the ability to develop features on an isolated
        branch, ensuring the stable version is not modified. These branches also allow for peer reveiws, allowing
        developers to review code through pull requests before committing to the main branch. "Very Nice." - Borat.
